Hello!
I am Rupanshi, a prefinal Year CSE Undergrad from Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneshwar. Working on new and inventive concepts to take shape and develop using tech has always been an area of intrigue for me 👩‍💻.

My mornings usually start with a good Novel and ends up with my Laptop, coding my nights away. I like Designing things 🌈, Building them and Exploring ways to improve their efficiency and performance 🚀
